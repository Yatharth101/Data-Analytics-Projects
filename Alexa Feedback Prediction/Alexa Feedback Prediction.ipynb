her name i know this is likely my fault but i would think the designer would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instruction a small deal for many device savvy people but a challenge for me', 'we are loving ours very much', 'i have the original alexa and the tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best i m happy to see they are making improvement with each new one it would be great to have update to our little a i s i think it would help out a lot with the bug in it all in all i am very happy with her and i can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble thank you', 'very pleased with the echo 2nd generation it is so nice to have alexa available for music weather news and probably a lot more we haven t discovered', 'i am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the echo if you are a big fan of deep bass this might not be sufficient for you though the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more a i evolve my home into a smart home the voice recognition is very impressive it is stylish and fun i have no regret with this purchase it is great for technically change people ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly if you have an elderly loved one this would be a great gift once connected to wifi it is very simple to use if you want unlimited music control be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj you can even have conversation with the echo i am not embarrassed to say that echo ha made me laugh a couple time when i ask it to

instruction except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iphone s wifi setting i called amazon customer service and i dunno what it is but lately i ve been getting terrible support the guy that took my call just rambled off a completely unhelpful script and i ended up setting up the dot while he wa in the middle of his spiel i m not sure if this is the norm or if it s because this is refurbished but the dot ha a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnect even though the app show that the range of my 5ghz connection is strong reconnecting is a pain each time a well all that said when alexa work she work amazingly well i don t have a speaker hooked up to it but one thing i really enjoy is the mic s range and sensitivity one of the more annoying limitation of apple s siri is that when she s playing audio through device speaker music podcasts etc the hey siri feature is all but useless alexa ha no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time and with amazingly fast responsiveness too i haven t tried this with louder speaker yet so i m not sure if this will continue to hold true setting up alexa to control all my wireless device wa a breeze albeit with limitation support for arlo device is nil and if you have special setting for your led device eg rainbow effect alexa can t handle them she only know how to change solid color and brightness level all in all my rating would ve been lower had i not gotten a decent price on this item if the connectivity problem persist i may have to exchange return this item i don t want to though alexa s kind of growing on me', 'i bought it because everyone wa saying how much they love theirs but i have no need for it i only used it once the volume wa not loud enough for me when i played music while i

moment is that we have several echo device in our home and i would like to use them a intercom which i am told can be done however i can t make any of the echo aware of the others existence when i ask

our stereo for me the next day i asked the echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song the echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before it wa a little disconcerting', 'i like echo spot i bought it to use a an alarm clock one negative that i didnt really think about when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy it hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm or hard to remember command to snooze for a few minute in this case a clock with button seems to work better', 'this is our second echo spot to go

my bed side i drop in on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling', 'terrific sound for a small device and nice form factor for the nightstand i like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking alexa not using video much but it would be nice if the device had a square rectangular screen', 'new to alexa like this spot a lot', 'it s not perfect but i really like this little gizmo i bought it primarily for 2 purpose first so i could set wake up alarm by individual day and set the wake up music individually by the day second i wanted to control a bedroom light by voice so i could shut it off a i wa falling asleep without having to get out of bed to turn a switch the echo spot together with a smart plug ha been able to accomplish that a bonus ha been getting alexa to play music from my amazon prime playlist what s not so great is that sometimes alexa ha a really hard time understanding instruction and repeating and altering the way you say thing can get pretty frustrating hopefully the ai get better in the future along with added function', 'i love it it is so easy to use', 'put this on my night stand to use a a clock and alarm work great every morning i get the weather and news when i get up also reminds me of all the appointment my wife and i have', 'love it', 'part of it is my fault i thought it could be wireless though for the price i still feel like it should be also the sound quality and volume could be better i prefer the tap unless you really want to have the call option but today most of u have phone computer or

off', 'the ease to use product', 'so far pretty happy with the spot for me it really is a glorified alarm clock radio and i know i could have something more cost effective but eh i like it i had read the review about the scrolling issue and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did so far so good', 'i am just entering the 34 smart 34 technology world i haven t figured it all out yet but

alarm clock it is the perfect bedside counter device alarm wake up music weather top news story etc perfect device for what i wanted and doe so much more than i expected it to do calling feature is also a huge selling point this is a must own item probably will grab more echo in the future', 'a an alexa device it work just a well a any of the other product unfortunately it doesn t go up from there the ability to play video is very limited you can not play youtube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen make it look very strange there is quite a selection of clock face and you can control what is display with one glaring and very annoying exception you can t turn off the 34 thing to try 34 screen you can turn off the screen scroll but that defeat the purpose of having the screen i don t need to be reminded every 5 second what thing i can do with alexa i don t need the advertising especially at the cost of this device overall it an expensive alexa device with a screen that s not very useful and annoying i would not recommend this until the amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that s actually useful', 'so far so good', 'this device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock i love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room it the first nightstand clock i have had in my bedroom in year because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clock bother me when trying to sleep the screen on this dims when the light in the room go out and is not bothersome at all overall a great addition to my smart home it nice to be able

thing i talk to it through wall and in other room i have been an amazon lover for a while so i have amazon music unlimited kindle unlimited prime video etc so i wa ready for this when it came out the

swipe to dismiss and ii if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss then you completely delete your recurring alarm this is especially annoying a amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but not delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snooze or turn it off but a the clock ha been out for a year

t get the show because it look like it came from the 1990 s and is downright ugly i have no interest on watching anything on these device anyway so the spot s screen doe not bother me although it is very clear alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere my favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it s hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar where i can just say play any song i want and it will i guess i could just pick up my smartphone to do that but you don t know how much easier it is to interact with medium using your voice rather than navigating through multiple page the one thing that i am not a fan of is the home screen card do not really rotate that much they also do not rotate when playing music i d love for it to display the weather a i listen to music the screen is clear and i also really enjoy alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different place that you program and name so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parent and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic i have this programmed for my parent fiance parent work and her work so it really work great the one thing that i actually preferred the dot over the spot is the dot will light up different color when you have package notification i have not seen the spot really do much for package notification yet the dot it wa very easy to tell when something wa delivered i would recommend amazon do exactly what they did for the dot but on the spot the dot light up color why can t the spot the same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery overall it s a great device that i am looking forward to integrating my home around i m already looking at dash button smart plug etc and when i become a home owner instead of renting where i can t tinker with my thermostat i will be purchasing a nest down the road for hvac integration', 'the screen response time is way better than i expected sound quality is good too also it s not so bright that i have to turn off the screen but it is an

see 34 thing to try 34 whenever i use a voice command with it even setting it to rotate once start this crap over again when you dare to actually use the device i m not a child and i don t need to be told a hundred time how to play music on it and having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tip is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed why doesn t amazon fix

different schedule try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying alexa set an alarm for 5am and then having alexa repeat ok alarm set for 5am not good i suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid plain and simple this device need to be brought into the 1990 s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm i know there is a cumbersome interface for these situation where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone no thanks if i m picking up my phone to set an alarm i will just use it built in alarm and save a step at least the engineer allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen so for example if you wake up a few minute early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse the interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that ha gone off is however not great there should be separate snooze and cancel button currently a touch snooze and a swipe

a hub i wasn t even considering the echo in part because i didn t know it wa a hub but also because i didn t really think i would find much use for another ai system if you re looking for a hub why settle for a plane hub when you can get a personal assistant that doe so much more and yet cost s the same or le than other hub oh and by the way for the same price a the amazon echo plus alone i

update the bulb to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new iot device if you do you will end up needing to update to a

impressed with the clarity and volume you will need a paid subscription to some form of steaming audio that s just a sad fact it ll play pandora and spotify but it s limited in skip and song selection without a subscriptiondoes not stream youtube music or youtube audioapple user will be disappointed to see that it s not a convenient a an apple deviceoverall i still loved the device but i ll be getting the dot which ha an audio out jack a doe the echo plus and just connect to external speaker', 'i have been thinking about getting this for a long time and wa excited when it arrived bundled with a philip hue bulb the excited ended quickly i spend about a total of 4 hour attempting to add this bulb to my alexa echo plus everything i tried ended in a discovery failed message i tried to set this up over and over and over again i watched youtube video i read set up website i wa the poster child of insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different result the next day i went onto amazon to get the tech support i wa hoping something would be done to make this thing work but also the problem not being operator error well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr and 19 min of being on the phone it still didn t work this product ha tested my patience so far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school the only reason i gave this two star is because amazon will be sending me a different echo plus and light bulb the problem wasn t the bulb because before packing up the item i purchased another bulb and still alexa couldn t locate this device i pray the next attempt is successful and then i will revise this rating but what are the odds that i wa shipped a defective echo the support person had the same thought maybe i should be exploring the google device but i can t get over the look of that hub it look like a defuser i can t believe i didn t find youtube video that show the problem i did everything looked simple and seamless not the experience i had ok i m done with this review because i spend enough wasted time this weekend already', 'got this in a pretty good deal during the prime day event it sound

expanded my alexa usage by adding a few echo dot around the house and finally decided to jump and buy an echo plus let me tell you what great choice a much a i love my original echo the plus wa an obvious upgrade immediately noticeable the sound is great and the fact that it s got a built in hub for the philip hue light is a huge plus', 'received the wrong product wa so excited to install it

ge link bulb', 'i got it to try side by side with the echo originale they are essentially the same in dimension weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub a many folk already pointed out the hub is not a direct replacement for the philip hue z wave or anything else it provides a sub set of feature available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub for me the voice recognition and music play capability is the same the original echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speaker the new echo plus is priced lower than the original echo with the built in hub but i don t really need the hub with le functionality in addition i don t think that amazon will have software update for this hub a other dedicated hub would have so bug could end up never fixed my philip hub get software update probably once every couple month and it keep up with the change in the new bulb fw and they fix bug net net for me this echo doe not do anything more than the original echo and sound quality is not a good with the original echo available a refurbished i would check that out first before considering this or the new echo which is clearly inferior to both of these', 'why do we need to buy a 100 hub to get it to work with samsung tv s and many other device i want my money back this thing won t even turn on my tv unless i buy another hub what s the point of having a hub that doesn t support half the device out there don t buy this thing unless you

the bulb all it doe is turn the light on off and dim it will not change color you still have to have a hue bridge to have full function of all the feature of the bulb i wish i d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo i already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and i ll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the light', 'at a volume setting of half or le the speaker sound like there is something rattling crackling or vibrating in it i d understand if the volume wa set higher all speaker get distorted when over driven but this doesn t sound like this is an over driven case sound like more of a rattle crackle possibly because the bass is too high learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristic other than volume i will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem', 'the sound is fantastic for the classic music is like you have the orchestra at your home and you can control

description on something that is happening today or something special that happened year ago on that day a well a sang him happy birthday lolol he now ha educated him self on thing he never knew and

room on an island kitchen counter the mic and speaker go in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good i connected the echo via bluetooth to my sony soundbar on my tv but find the echo placement and 360 sound more appealing it s no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass the sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbor in my building the knob on the top work great for adjusting volume this is my first echo device and i would imagine having to press volume button on the echo 2 a large inconvenience and not a precise for that alone i would recommend this over the regular echo 2nd generation the piece look quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it the rubber material on the bottom ha a good grip on the granite counter my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over this order came with a free philip hue bulb which i installed along with an extra one i bought i put the 2 bulb into my living room floor lamp turned on the light and all i had to do wa say 34 alexa connect my device 34 the default name for each bulb wa assigned a 34 first light 34 and 34 second light 34 so i can have a dimmer floor lamp if i just turned on off one of the light by saying 34 alexa turn off the second light 34 in the alexa app i created a group with 34 first light 34 and 34 second light 34 and named the group 34 the light 34 so to turn on the lamp with both bulb shining i just say 34 alexa turn on the light 34 i wa surprised how easily the bulb connected to the echo plus with it built in hub i thought i would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb i wa surprised by that awesome you will feel like tony stark on this device i added quite a few 34 skill 34 like thunderstorm sound and quote of the day alexa always load them up quickly adding song that you hear to specific playlist on amazon music is also a great feature i can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership i wa lucky to buy this for 100 on prime day but i think for 150 is it pretty expensive considering the echo 2 is only 100 in my opinion you will be paying a premium for the echo plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you 1 taller and 360 sound unit 2 volume knob on top that you spin i think this is a huge benefit over button 3 built in hub for hue bulb after researching more there are some con to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setup for me and my floor lamp it s just perfect i highly recommend it and will buy an echo dot for my bedroom now', 'easy to install very clear speaker i took one star off because it wa delivered late by ontrac like usual', 'love love love', '', 'good product', 'i would like to tell you that i have a reason to hate it like the speaker suck or the color or the shape or even the way it smell but i can honestly say the number reason i

have cycled power to the echo unit with each attempt i work in the network technology industry for a living and have for over 20 year now so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here i

lock up on my phone and i have to force the app to close restart my phone and the echo and try again i figured 3x s wa enough it shouldn t be that hard a techie i can only imagine how bad this will
